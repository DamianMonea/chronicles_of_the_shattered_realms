# Chronicles of the Shattered Realms

## Quick description:

Chronicles of the Shattered Realms is a small text-based RPG game, written in C++.
The game serves as a support project for my book, "OOP with C++".

## Game setting

The game takes place in a world named Elyria, a land of 5 realms, each governed by different elemental powers: Earth, Fire, Water, Air and Aether. These realms were once united, but a great calamity known as "The Shattering" fractured the land, scattering pieces across a vast and mysterious void.

### Backstory

Centuries ago, Elyria was a land of harmony, where the elemental realms coexisted under the guidance of the Archmages. However, a dark force emerged, seeking to control the elemental cores â€“ the sources of each realm's power. The Archmages sacrificed themselves to prevent this, causing the Shattering. The realms, now floating islands in a void, have developed independently, forgetting their shared past and the looming threat.

### Main plot

The player is a descendant of the Archmages, born during a rare celestial alignment, granting them the unique ability to traverse the void and manipulate multiple elemental powers. The player's journey begins with a prophecy, foretelling the return of the dark force. The player must travel across the shattered realms, rekindling alliances, learning about the ancient past, and gathering artifacts necessary to rebuild the Core of Unity, the only power capable of defeating the darkness and reuniting Elyria.
